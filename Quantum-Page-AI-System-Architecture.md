# Quantum-Page AI – System Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary
Quantum-Page AI is a cloud–native SaaS platform that automatically designs, builds, deploys, and continuously optimizes high-performance, SEO-ready websites (e-commerce, blogs, local business sites, review/affiliate pages, funnels, PBN stacks) on WordPress, AWS Lightsail/EC2 stacks, and Microsoft Azure App Service.  
The system combines large-language-model (LLM) powered assistants, proprietary SEO heuristics, and low-code templates to give small businesses and marketing agencies an “instant senior Google engineer” at their fingertips.

## 2. System Overview
• Multi-tenant SaaS with segregated tenant workspaces  
• Event-driven micro-service backend orchestrated by Kubernetes  
• AI Content & SEO Engine executes keyword research, site hierarchy, copy generation, schema injection, and ranking diagnostics  
• Site Orchestrator provisions WordPress instances or static Jamstack sites on AWS/Azure, applies themes, plugins, and CDN configuration  
• Real-time Analytics Pipeline streams visit, ranking, and conversion data into a unified dashboard with actionable playbooks  
• Companion Android/iOS apps surface core metrics and AI chat guidance

## 3. Technology Stack
| Layer | Primary Choices | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript, Next.js (SSR/SSG) | PWA baseline, universal components shared with mobile |
| Mobile | React Native, Expo | Single codebase, OTA updates |
| API Gateway | GraphQL (Apollo) + REST fallback | Subscription & mutation channels over WebSockets |
| Backend Runtime | Node.js 20 (TypeScript), Python 3.12 (AI tasks) | Polyglot micro-services |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes (EKS on AWS, AKS on Azure) | Helm charts for portability |
| Datastores | PostgreSQL (tenant DB), Redis (cache/queue), S3/Blob (assets), DynamoDB option for scale | All encrypted at rest |
| AI/ML | OpenAI or Azure OpenAI LLMs, in-house fine-tuned models via Hugging Face, LangChain orchestration | Pluggable provider abstraction |
| CMS | Headless WordPress (Dockerized) with WP-CLI automation | Toolkit for multitenant hardening |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions → Argo CD | Blue/green & canary support |
| Observability | Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, OpenTelemetry | Centralised tracing and alerting |
| Security | Keycloak (OIDC), HashiCorp Vault, AWS/Azure KMS | Zero-trust, secrets management |

## 4. Core Components
1. **User & Billing Service**  
   Multi-tenant auth (OIDC), subscription plans, usage metering, Stripe integration.
2. **Site Orchestrator Service**  
   Spins up WordPress containers or static site buckets, configures domains, SSL via Let’s Encrypt, sets CDN (CloudFront / Azure Front Door).
3. **AI Content & SEO Engine**  
   • Keyword & topic modeling  
   • Prompt pipelines for copy, product descriptions, meta tags, schema  
   • SERP monitoring & re-optimization loops.
4. **Template & Asset Manager**  
   Library of themes, Elementor/Bricks templates, funnel and page blocks, AI-generated media assets.
5. **Analytics & Insights Pipeline**  
   Edge events → Kafka → Stream processing (Flink) → OLAP store (ClickHouse) → Dashboard API.
6. **Automation & Scheduler**  
   Cron-like workflows (e.g., regenerate sitemap weekly, refresh expired content, social posting).
7. **Notification & Coaching Bot**  
   Uses LLM with RAG over site metrics to push personalized growth advice via web/mobile and email.
8. **Mobile App Gateway**  
   Slim BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) optimizing payloads for mobile.

## 5. Data Flow Architecture
1. User configures new project → Frontend sends GraphQL mutation.  
2. Site Orchestrator spins new WordPress pod, stores credentials in Vault, returns deployment URL.  
3. AI Engine receives “Generate Content” event → fetches keyword list → calls LLM → writes drafts to WordPress via REST API.  
4. Upon publish, Webhooks emit “ContentPublished” event → Scheduler queues social share & ping search engines.  
5. Visitor traffic hits CDN → edge logs streamed to Kafka → Analytics Pipeline aggregates KPIs.  
6. Insights Bot queries OLAP, crafts recommendations → pushes to dashboard & mobile notifications.

---

## 6. Integration Points
• **Payment**: Stripe / Paddle for global payments  
• **Email & Transactional**: AWS SES / SendGrid  
• **Search Console & Analytics**: Google Search Console, GA4, Bing Webmaster API  
• **Social APIs**: Meta, X, LinkedIn, Pinterest for automated posting  
• **Ad Networks**: Google Ads, Amazon Ads for campaign sync  
• **CDN/Edge**: CloudFront, Azure Front Door, Cloudflare optional  
• **Third-party AI**: OpenAI, Stability AI (images), Grammarly API (proofing)

---

## 7. Scalability Considerations
• Stateless micro-services enable horizontal pod auto-scaling on CPU/RAM/queue length.  
• Multi-region Kubernetes clusters with global load balancer for latency and fail-over.  
• Sharded Postgres using Citus or Aurora Serverless v2 for tenant isolation at scale.  
• Event streaming via Kafka partitions to scale content generation and analytics independently.  
• CDN edge caching reduces origin load; image/video transcoding offloaded to Lambda/Azure Functions.

---

## 8. Security Architecture
• Zero-trust network: all service-to-service calls authenticated by mTLS and SPIFFE IDs.  
• Role-based Access Control: tenant admins vs agency collaborators; granular site scopes.  
• Secrets & keys stored in Vault/KMS; no secrets in code or container images.  
• Automated dependency scanning (Snyk), container image signing (Cosign), runtime policy (Kyverno).  
• Data encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).  
• Regular penetration testing and compliance mapping (SOC 2 Type II roadmap, GDPR readiness).  
• Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF / Azure WAF) with OWASP ruleset.
